# My personal analysis of the project

Overall, this project was a new experience for me as it was my first time dealing with a programming project. I found it quite difficult to work with C language but I was able to eventually reach the objectives. Although it was challenging, I found it fun and I enjoyed it a lot, particularly because the project was focused on game development. Throughout the process, I learned a lot and gained valuable experience. Overall, it was a challenging but enjoyable experience and I am satisfied with the outcome of the project.
